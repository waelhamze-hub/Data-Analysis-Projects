# SALARIES BY COLLEGE MAJOR — EARNINGS, RISK & CAREER POTENTIAL

This project explores a dataset of **starting and mid-career salaries by U.S. college major**.  
We analyze salary levels, earning potential, and salary spread (risk vs reward) across different fields of study.

## Objectives
- Identify majors with the **highest and lowest starting salaries**.
- Find majors with the **highest and lowest mid-career salaries**.
- Calculate **salary spread (90th − 10th percentile)** to measure career risk vs reward.
- Compare broad groups (STEM, Business, Humanities, etc.).
- Visualize salary distributions for clarity.

## Dataset
- **File:** `salaries_by_college_major.csv`  
- **Columns:**
  - `Undergraduate Major`
  - `Starting Median Salary`
  - `Mid-Career Median Salary`
  - `Mid-Career 10th Percentile Salary`
  - `Mid-Career 90th Percentile Salary`
  - `Group` (broad field of study)


## Tools & Libraries
- **Python**
- **Pandas** → data cleaning & analysis
- **Matplotlib** → visualizations
- **Jupyter Notebook** (VS Code)

## Analysis & Results
- **Highest Starting Salary:** found among STEM fields (e.g., Engineering).  
- **Highest Mid-Career Salary:** also dominated by STEM majors.  
- **Lowest Salaries:** generally appear in Humanities and Education.  
- **Risk vs Reward:** some majors have a **large salary spread** (top earners far ahead of low earners).  
- **Group Comparisons:** Engineering leads on average; Humanities trails behind.

## Conclusion & Insights
- **STEM majors** dominate both starting and mid-career salaries.  
- **Humanities and Education majors** tend to earn less throughout careers.  
- **High spread majors** indicate high risk/reward outcomes.  
- **Engineering** consistently ranks as the top group for earnings.

This analysis shows how choice of major can influence both **early career opportunities** and **long-term earning potential**.
